This is a list of the behaviors of invalid ([[glitch]]) choices for the badge describer's badge list in Cerulean City. This list is currently for {{RB}}.

==Sources==
*Kelvinv

==Notes==
The badge items display their normal badge texts. and when the order is changed in the hex editor, the texts also will change correctly

ROM addresses 74E6E through 74e76 control the items that the Badge man lists. These are loaded in game at addresses cf7c until cf84 when you open the badge list. The normal badge items are 15-1C.
